# write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target integer
# the function should use the binary search algorithm to determine if the target integer is contained in the array
# and should return its index if it is, otherwise -1

# INPUTS/OUTPUTS
# array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73], target = 33 => 3
