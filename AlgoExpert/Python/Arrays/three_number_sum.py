# write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum
# the function should find all triplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and return a two-dimensional array of all these triplets
# the numbers in each triplet should be ordered in ascending order, and the triplets themselves should be ordered in ascending order with respect to the numbers they hold.
